<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nstudio.portalplus) -->

As learning at the [University??!?] of Greenwich in Vietnam, I find that the quality of the academic portal is not so good. It makes students harder to find information and feel uncomfortable with a not-modern graphical interface.

I decided to create this project two years ago when I had some free time. This mobile app is just a hobby project to resolve miscellaneous needs and will not be maintained regularly; please note.

The main missions of this project are:
* Provide you with a better graphical interface in this application.
* See your daily & weekly calendar faster, in an easier way.
* Manage your life at school.
* ... and maybe a social place where you can see your buddies?
As this is just a hobby project, feel free to contribute and make a PR if you would like to do so.
I welcome all of you to redistribute or make it better by your way.
